But NextLeap made the journey structured, practical, and inspiring. The program stands out for its industry-relevant curriculum, hands-on projects like product teardowns, PRDs, and mock interviews, and mentorship from experienced product leaders. The community is one of the most active and supportive I've seen — you’re constantly learning from peers, mentors, and alumni. One of the biggest value-adds for me was the “Learn in Public” challenge, which helped me improve my written communication and build a portfolio. I also gained clarity on how to structure my thought process, use tools like Jira, Figma, SQL, and communicate user-first solutions confidently. If you're serious about becoming a product manager and want a guided, immersive experience, I highly recommend NextLeap – it is one of the best product management courses out there.",
